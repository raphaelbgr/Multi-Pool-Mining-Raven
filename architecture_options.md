# Mining Architecture Options

## Option 1: Custom CUDA Miner (RECOMMENDED)
**How it works:**
- `get_jobs.py` connects to all 5 pools simultaneously
- Creates `headers.bin` with jobs for all pools
- `miner.cu` calculates nonces for ALL pools in parallel
- When a valid nonce is found, submits to the correct pool

**Advantages:**
- TRUE multi-pool mining
- Maximum efficiency
- Already mostly working

**Command:**
```bash
python auto_miner.py
```

## Option 2: T-Rex Single Pool (STANDARD)
**How it works:**
- T-Rex connects directly to ONE pool
- No proxy needed
- Standard mining approach

**Advantages:**
- Simple and reliable
- T-Rex works as designed

**Command:**
```bash
t-rex.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060 -u RGpVV4jjVhBvKYhT4kouUcndfr3VpwgxVU -w worker1
```

## Option 3: T-Rex Round-Robin Proxy (COMPLEX)
**How it works:**
- Proxy switches between pools every few minutes
- T-Rex only sees one pool at a time
- Much more complex

**Disadvantages:**
- Not true multi-pool mining
- Complex to implement
- Less efficient

## CURRENT PROBLEM:
The system is trying to mix Option 1 and Option 2, which doesn't work!

## RECOMMENDATION:
Use Option 1 (Custom CUDA Miner) - it's already 90% working and can do TRUE multi-pool mining.
