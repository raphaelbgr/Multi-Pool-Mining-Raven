# KawPow Multi-Pool CUDA Mining Solution - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **FR1**: Enable single CUDA iteration to test nonces against multiple Raven pools simultaneously
- **FR2**: Implement true multi-pool hash calculation for KawPow algorithm
- **FR3**: Integrate BMAD framework with XMRig for efficient multi-pool mining
- **FR4**: Create parallel KawPow kernel that processes multiple job contexts in one iteration
- **FR5**: Develop memory-efficient multi-pool DAG and cache management
- **FR6**: Implement coordinated share submission to multiple pools from single hash computation
- **FR7**: Achieve 3-5x efficiency improvement over current single-pool approach
- **FR8**: Maintain compatibility with existing XMRig infrastructure

### Background Context

The current KawPow mining approach suffers from a fundamental inefficiency: each CUDA iteration only tests nonces against a single pool's job parameters. This creates a significant waste of computational power because:

1. **Single Job Blob Limitation**: Each pool has unique block headers (blob), extranonces, and targets
2. **Universal Job Flaw**: The "universal job" concept doesn't work for KawPow due to algorithm-specific requirements
3. **Hash Recalculation Need**: Each pool requires its own hash calculation with specific parameters
4. **Computational Waste**: 80-90% of hash computations are wasted on single-pool validation

The solution requires architectural changes at the CUDA kernel level to enable true multi-pool mining where one CUDA iteration can test the same nonce against multiple pools simultaneously, effectively multiplying mining efficiency rather than dividing it.
